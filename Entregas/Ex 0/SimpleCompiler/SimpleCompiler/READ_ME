This directory contains the code for "A simple traditional modular
compiler/interpreter", from Sections 1.2 and 4.2.3.

The programs are run on a few simple expressions, given in the Makefile.

make test_interpr
	Runs the (recursive) interpreter from Figure 1.19.

make test_codegen
	Runs the code generator from Figure 1.18, producing stack code.

make test_itinter
	Runs the iterative interpreter from Figure 4.6.

make test_vnaivcg
	Runs the trivial code generator from Figure 4.12, producing C code.

make test_vnaivcg2
	Runs the partially evaluating code generator from Figure 4.16,
	producing C code.

make test_generated
	Compiles and tests some code generated by the trivial code generator
	from Figure 4.12.

make test_generated2
	Compiles and tests some code generated by the partially
	evaluating code generator from Figure 4.16.

The code from Chapter 4 requires threading before code generation can
begin.  Two threading routines are supplied.  For their application, see
the Makefile.
